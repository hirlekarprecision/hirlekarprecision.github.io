                <h4>Note</h4>
                <p>Differential pressure instruments are used to monitor pressure drop across strainer used in line with positive displacement flow meters. Petroleum oil companies and chemical plants etc. use positive displacement flow meters to measure volume. Contaminated fluids can damage these expensive and critical flow meters. These meters need filtered fluids for proper functioning, so strainers are used. Positive displacement flow meter manufacturers specify maximum pressure drop across the meter including strainer to the buyer for designing the pumping system. If pressure drop across the strainer increases than specified, the pumping energy cost increases. Piston type differential pressure instruments therefore become ideal for this application.

                <p>In pharmaceutical industry, hospitals, semiconductor industry sophisticated air handling and filtration units are used.

                <p>In pharmaceutical, food and chemical processes, small batches of compounds are to be dried. Dryers specially made for this purpose use hot dry air. Air is sucked from the room through filters and blown over heater coils. The blower forces this hot air through the compound to be dried. Part of the compound gets carried along with the air while being removed by an exhaust blower. A collector or bag filter is used to collect it. MagneticTM instruments are used for pre-filter as well as collector filter to monitor clogging. MagneticTM instrument with switch can start cleaning cycle of collector filter at preset differential pressure.

                <p>Diaphragm type differential pressure instruments are used across heat exchangers to measure pressure difference in transformer oil cooling system. Here heat exchanger uses a higher pressure on one side to ensure direction of leakage and avoid mixing of water with oil. This is essential for safety of transformer. In transformer oil cooling system, where oil is at a higher temperature is passed through heat exchanger with water as cooling medium. Instruments with switch in such application, provides a signal for alarm at a preset value of pressure difference.

                  <br> Other than above, differential pressure gauge is also used to measure differential pressure across the heat exchanger where pressure drop increases due to scaling.

                  <p>Diaphragm type differential pressure instrument can be used to monitor pump performance. Addition of switch is very useful to monitor pumps installed at remote locations. The malfunctioning of a pump or blockage in a pipeline will lead to increase or decrease in differential pressure. This change in differential pressure can be used to warn the operator for high or low settings. </p>
