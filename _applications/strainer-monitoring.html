category: Filter Monitoring
title: Strainer monitoring
description: Used to monitor pressure drops across strainers in petroleum/ chemical industry.
advantages: Cost effective way to monitor pressure drop in petroleum / chemical industry.
note: |
  Differential pressure instruments are used to monitor pressure drop across strainer used in line with positive displacement flow meters. Petroleum oil companies and chemical plants etc. use positive displacement flow meters to measure volume. Contaminated fluids can damage these expensive and critical flow meters. These meters need filtered fluids for proper functioning, so strainers are used. Positive displacement flow meter manufacturers specify maximum pressure drop across the meter including strainer to the buyer for designing the pumping system. If pressure drop across the strainer increases than specified, the pumping energy cost increases. Piston type differential pressure instruments therefore become ideal for this application.
