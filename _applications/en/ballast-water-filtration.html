description: Used to monitor ballast water filter
advantages: Cost effective way to monitor ballast water filters in the marine industry
note: |
  Ballast water is an integral part in the smooth functioning of a ship. Ballast tanks are filled and discharged depending upon whether the ship is being loaded or unloaded. When a ship discharges its ballast tanks in another part of the world there is a high risk of introduction of alien marine organisms in the local waters. It is required that water be filtered to remove marine organisms and sediments before it is fed to ballast tanks. A differential pressure gauge is mounted across a marine filter and it is used to start the auto cleaning cycle once a certain preset differential pressure is reached.
