note: |
  In pharmaceutical, food and chemical processes, small batches of compounds are to be dried. Dryers specially made for this purpose use hot dry air. Air is sucked from the room through filters and blown over heater coils. The blower forces this hot air through the compound to be dried. Part of the compound gets carried along with the air while being removed by an exhaust blower. A collector or bag filter is used to collect it. MagneticTM instruments are used for pre-filter as well as collector filter to monitor clogging. MagneticTM instrument with switch can start cleaning cycle of collector filter at preset differential pressure.
