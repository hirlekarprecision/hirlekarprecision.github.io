note: |
  Diaphragm instruments can be used as liquid level indicators. With high pressure port connected to a tapping at the bottom of tank and low port kept open to atmosphere as shown. Differential pressure instrument calibrated in units like mm, inches of water etc. can be used to measure liquid level as a function of head (differential pressure) which is specified by the user. If the tanks are closed or pressurized, the low pressure port can be connected to the top of the tank as shown in the figure. Regardless of the tank pressure, liquid inside will give similar head as in an open tank and the instrument will indicate level. To measure the correct level in open tanks, the instrument should be mounted at the bottom level of the tank.
