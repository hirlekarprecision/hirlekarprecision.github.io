advantages: 
note: |
  Diaphragm type differential pressure instrument calibrated in weight or volume is effectively used in cryogenic tank level monitoring.  Tanks can be stationery - vertical or horizontal.  These instruments are used in tanker transport vehicles too.  Typically, these instruments have dry gauge design with no liquid filling in case. 
  <b>Drastic temperature changes &amp; condensation:</b> For environments with drastic temperature changes, condensation might occur on glass. In this case, LX series cases are recommended which can be opened and cleaned. 
  <b>Cleaned for oxygen service:</b> All instruments are cleaned for oxygen service.  3 scales: Dials can be produced to show LIN LOX LOR in 3 scales.  CO2 tanks can also use these gauges. 
  <b>Remote Applications:</b> 700 DGC is also available with a switch option for monitoring of gauges in remote application.
