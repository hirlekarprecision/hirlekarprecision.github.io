description: Gauge with switch is set to signal an alarm at a preset value of pressure difference.
advantages: Used for safety of a transformer
note: |
  Diaphragm type differential pressure instruments are used across heat exchangers to measure pressure difference in transformer oil cooling system. Here heat exchanger uses a higher pressure on one side to ensure direction of leakage and avoid mixing of water with oil. This is essential for safety of transformer. In transformer oil cooling system, where oil is at a higher temperature is passed through heat exchanger with water as cooling medium. Instruments with switch in such application, provides a signal for alarm at a preset value of pressure difference. 

  Other than above, differential pressure gauge is also used to measure differential pressure across the heat exchanger where pressure drop increases due to scaling.
