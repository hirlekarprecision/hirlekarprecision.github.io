summary: |
  In the Hirlekar Precision Model EX-200 DPG, the movement of the piston is converted into appropriate calibrated rotary movement of the pointer through a magnetic connection. This type of piston model is used in applications where minor migration of the media from high pressure side (HP) to low pressure side (LP) is permitted. The explosion proof box manufactured by Akron (USA) is ATEX approved.
