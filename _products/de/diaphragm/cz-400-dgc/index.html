summary: |
  In the Hirlekar Precision Model CZ 400 DGC, the movement of the diaphragm is converted into appropriate calibrated rotary movement of the pointer through a magnetic connection. This type of piston model is used in applications where no migration of the media from high pressure side (HP) to low pressure side (LP) is permitted.
  <b>Center Zero</b> This gauge is designed with a center zero.
