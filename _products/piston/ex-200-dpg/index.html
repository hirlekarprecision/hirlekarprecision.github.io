title: EX 200 DPG
category: piston
summary: |
  In the Hirlekar Precision Model EX-200 DPG, the movement of the piston is converted into appropriate calibrated rotary movement of the pointer through a magnetic connection. This type of piston model is used in applications where minor migration of the media from high pressure side (HP) to low pressure side (LP) is permitted.

pressureRange: |
  0-0.25 to 0-70 bar
  0-5 to 0-1050 psi

features: |
  Akron Electric USA explosion proof enclosure is ATEX approved.
