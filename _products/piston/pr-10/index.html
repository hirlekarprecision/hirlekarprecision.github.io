title: PR 10
category: piston
summary: |
  In the flameproof Model PR 10, the movement of the piston is converted into appropriate calibrated rotary movement of the pointer through a magnetic connection. This type of piston model is used in applications where minor migration of the media from high pressure side (HP) to low pressure side (LP) is permitted.
  <b>Approval:</b> Model PR 10 is Ex d IIC T6 IP66 approved.

pressureRange: |
  0-0.25 to 0-10 bar
  0-5 to 0-150 psi

features: |
  Model PR 10 is recommended in applications where flame proof instruments are required.
