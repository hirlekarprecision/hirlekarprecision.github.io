title: GX 100
category: diaphragm
summary: |
  In the Model GX 100, designed specifically for the gas industry, the movement of the diaphragm is converted into appropriate calibrated rotary movement of the pointer through a magnetic connection between piston magnet and rotary magnet. This type of piston model is used in applications where minor migration of media from high pressure side (HP) to low pressure side (LP) is permitted.
