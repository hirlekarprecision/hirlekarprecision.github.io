title: CZ 300 DGC
category: diaphragm
summary: |
  In the Hirlekar Precision Model CZ 300 DGC, the movement of the diaphragm is converted into appropriate calibrated rotary movement of the pointer through a magnetic connection. This type of piston model is used in applications where no migration of the media from high pressure side (HP) to low pressure side (LP) is permitted.
  <b>Center Zero</b> This gauge is designed with a center zero.

pressureRange: |
  In bar: 0.75 – 0 – 0.075
  In psi: 4 – 0 – 4

features: |
  Model CZ 300 DGC is also available in body material made of Monel for marine applications.
