title: 400 DGC
productType: diaphragm
summary: |
  In the Hirlekar Precision Model 400 DGC, the movement of the diaphragm is converted into appropriate calibrated rotary movement of the pointer through a magnetic connection. This type of piston model is used in applications where no migration of the media from high pressure side (HP) to low pressure side (LP) is permitted.
  <b>In case of condensation:</b> New LX series engineering polymer case is recommended. In operating condition with frequent temperature fluctuations, condensation may occur on the glass affecting visibility. Hirlekar Precision’s LX Series Engineering polymer cases can be easily opened and cleaned on site.
