title: 600 DGC
productType: diaphragm
summary:
  In this model, the movement of the convoluted diaphragm, and hence corresponding magnet, is converted into appropriate calibrated rotary movement of the pointer through a magnetic connection. This type of piston model is used in applications where no migration of the media from high pressure side (HP) to low pressure side (LP) is permitted.
