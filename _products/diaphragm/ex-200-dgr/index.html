title: EX 200 DGR
category: diaphragm
summary:
  In the Hirlekar Precision Model EX-200 DGR, the movement of the diaphragm is converted into appropriate calibrated rotary movement of the pointer through a magnetic connection. This type of piston model is used in applications where no migration of the media from high pressure side (HP) to low pressure side (LP) is permitted.

pressureRange: |
  In bar: 0-0.25 to 0-7 bar
  In psi: 0-5 to 0-100 psi

features: |
  Akron Electric USA explosion proof enclosure is ATEX approved.
