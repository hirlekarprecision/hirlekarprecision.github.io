title: PR 20
category: diaphragm
summary: |
  In the Flameproof Model PR 20, the movement of the diaphragm, and hence the movement of the piston magnet is converted into appropriate calibrated rotary movement of the pointer through a magnetic connection. This type of piston model is used in applications where no migration of the media from high pressure side (HP) to low pressure side (LP) is permitted.
  <b>Approval:</b><mark> Model PR 20 is Ex d IIC T6 IP66 approved</mark>.
