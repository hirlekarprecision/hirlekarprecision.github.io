title: EX 400 DGC
category: diaphragm
language: en
summary:
  In the Hirlekar Precision Model EX-400 DGC, the movement of the diaphragm is converted into appropriate calibrated rotary movement of the pointer through a magnetic connection. This type of diaphragm model is used in applications where no migration of the media from high pressure side (HP) to low pressure side (LP) is permitted.
  The explosion proof box manufactured by Akron (USA) is ATEX approved.
